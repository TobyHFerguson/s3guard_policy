* Prevent Invalid use of S3Guard managed Folders
The script =create_s3_guard_policy.sh= will, given the name of an
existing cluster and an s3 bucket/folder reference, provide an s3
bucket policy which will limit the modification of objects placed in
that folder to only the IAM instance profile of the given cluster.

The purpose of this policy is to greatly reduce the chance of someone
changing the objects that S3Guard is managing.
* Execution
Run the script directly if you have the AWS and Altus CLIs installed.

Otherwise run the script using a docker image, thus:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
docker run -t -i -v $HOME/.aws:/root/.aws -v $HOME/.altus:/root/.altus tobyhferguson/create_s3_guard_policy:latest
#+END_SRC
